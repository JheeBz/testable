# traqsuite
A modern free and open source test case management solution.

# Why?
Most other solutions are either lidicrously expensive, hard to set up, or aren't particularly user-friendly. While nothing revolutionary, this project aims to provide everything you need for a test management solution for **free**.

There may be paid options in the future, but these would purely be support and/or cloud hosting.

# How to run in development

To run the front-end in a development environment, simply use the standard ```react-scripts``` [from create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app):

$ cd client
$ yarn start
```
## Back-end
The back-end is run with [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) through an identical script:

```
$ cd api
$ yarn start
```
